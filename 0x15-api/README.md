# 0x15. API :wrench:

Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers API management for system adminsitrations.
At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* What Bash scripting should not be used for
* What is an API
* What is a REST API
* What are microservices
* What is the CSV format
* What is the JSON format
* Pythonic Package and module name style
* Pythonic Class name style
* Pythonic Variable name style
* Pythonic Function name style
* Pythonic Constant name style
* Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python
